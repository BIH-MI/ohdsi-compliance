# OHDSI compliance
Implementing an [OHDSI](https://www.ohdsi.org/) installation can be challenging. While container technology has significantly simplified deployments from a technical perspective, regulatory compliance remains a major hurdle for the operation of such platforms. In this repository, we provide a comprehensive set of document templates designed to streamline the data protection and information security-relevant documentation and coordination efforts required to establish OHDSI installations. The documents are provided in different languages:
- [English](./en/README.md)
- [German](./de/README.md)

## Contact
If you have questions or encounter any problems with the templates, we would like to invite you to
[open an issue on Github](https://github.com/BIH-MI/ohdsi-compliance/issues). This allows
other users to collaborate and (hopefully) answer your question in a timely
manner. If your request contains confidential information or is not suited for a
public issue, send us an email.
