# OHDSI compliance
Deploying and maintaining an [OHDSI](https://www.ohdsi.org/) installation can be challenging. While container technology has significantly simplified deployments from a technical perspective, regulatory compliance can remain a major hurdle. In this repository, we provide a comprehensive set of document templates designed to streamline the data protection and information security-relevant documentation and coordination efforts required to establish OHDSI installations. The documents are provided in different languages:
- [English](./en/README.md)
- [German](./de/README.md)
